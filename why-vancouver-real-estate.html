                <h1>Why Religion is bad and Faith is stupid</h1>
                
                <a class="back-link" href="index">&larr; Back to that list of things that isn't this</a>
                
                <p>There, I said it. I'm probably going to receive a lot of shit for posting this, and that's unfortunate. Before you get all antsy in your religious pantsies, let me say that I don't have a problem with your right to religious freedom or expression. I have a problem with the fruits that religion bears. I have a problem with the lack of critical thinking that all too often ends at God.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of this article, I'm expressly ignoring the historical significance of religion. It's fantastic that historically it unified great swathes of people into groups, but I'm evaluating the merits of religion today, in modern times.</p>
                <p>A lot of people ask me why I even bother talking about religion - why I spend time discussing something that they feel is solely a personal choice, or why it matters at all. I talk about religion because it's important. It's something that, although highly personal, affects people every day in every corner of the globe. Its zealots kill or oppress people daily. Its moderates inform public policy. Its masses perpetuate myth.</p>
                <p>Before I continue on with my negativity, there are a number of positive elements that religion contributes to society (I think that many proponents would argue more than the negative), such as feeding the malnourished or sheltering the homeless. These indeed are honorable efforts driven by I believe places of good will. I do not believe, however, that religion is a requirement for these types of humanitarian efforts to take place. I refuse to accept that without the presence of religion, these efforts would cease to exist.</p>
    
                <h4>Speaking specifically, here's my beef</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Religion is by declaration a divisive force</li>
                    <li>Religion teaches faith is the most admirable virtue</li>
                    <li>Religious dogma affects everyone</li>
                    <li>Religious books are ancient; its morality is too</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h5>1. Religion is a divisive force</h5>
                <p>Religion fosters a very in-group mentality. Within a specific sect, cult, or religion, members can become very tight-knit. This can be a positive thing. When looking across religions, many of them are fundamentally incompatible. That is to say, they all can't be right. To each religion, all of the others are deemed incorrect. The way in which these differences in opinion are expressed varies from religion to religion, from culture to culture, and from geography to geography. At best, they ignore each other and somewhat co-exist, agreeing to disagree whenever an incompatibility arises. In the middle, each group tries to influence policy and adopt followers without rustling too many feathers. At worst, they exercise barbarism at its finest.</p>
               <p>To be fair, there are plenty of lines that divide modern society: class, race, gender, location, etcetera. The list goes on. Humanity clearly has enough ways in which it is divided in opinion. We need fewer of these divisions, not more.</p>

                <h5>2. Religion teaches Faith is the most admirable virtue</h5>
                <p>One of the most frustrating points in a discussion with a creationist is the concept of faith. In my opinion, faith is a terrible virtue, and I have serious questions about a deity that would favor faith.</p>
                <p>First, let's refresh ourselves on what the word really means. As defined by reference.com, Faith is described as "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith">belief that is not based on proof.</a>" If you're thinking right now, "Well, that's not what <em>I</em> believe. I believe that Faith is something that I just <em>feel</em> is true.", well, I hate to break it to you but your definition falls into that category.</p>
                <p>One thing that I often hear about how, as an "Atheist" I too have faith. Faith in scientists, and in science itself, or something like that. No. No no no no no. I <em>trust</em> findings of modern scientists because of the rigidity and the dependability of the scientific method which they employ. I can <em>observe</em> their conclusions that I am able to understand by seeing the fruits of their labor, by reading consensus in the scientific community at large, or by testing ideas myself. For topics beyond my comprehension, of which there are many, I can take comfort that the same scientific rigorousness was applied in their discovery. I take nothing at face value, and will readily abandon my notions about the world should they turn out to be false. That is one of the most liberating benefits of a life without dogma.</p>
                
                <p>Second, look at faith as a virtue. In our daily lives, we rely on reason, logic, and knowledge to survive. In this society, in this modern time, it's hard for us (myself included) to even comprehend what "survival" really is because we rarely (if ever) are forced to think about it. We know (as a collective) what foods are safe to eat, we know that lead is toxic to life, and we (most of us anyways) have a reasonable understanding of how to behave in society. We've learned this through a long chain of trial and error. When decisions in life are commonplace or simple, the answer is often dismissed as being common-sense. In reality, we're leveraging a vast source of knowledge to reach a conclusion. For example, the question <em>"Why shouldn't I put my finger into this electrical socket?"</em> is simple because experience, education, and understanding have taught you the answer. When we're faced with a more difficult question such as, "What happens when we die?", and don't have (or are reluctant to accept) the answer, many of us feel incredibly unsettled. This is where we turn to God. Neil deGrasse Tyson describes this pattern as the "perimeter of ignorance".
                <p>Third, in Christianity at least, the requirement for salvation is belief in the savior, and nothing else. Why would God really regard faith as such an important virtue? Why not love, compassion, honesty, or integrity? Why hold faith above these virtues? What kind of omnipotence would utter something like "My faithful disciple, you have believed in me when I have left you no reason to do so. You shall be eternally rewarded." You rely on your faculties to reach conclusions about every other aspect in your life, from finances to food, from health to technology. Hold your religious beliefs to the same level of scrutiny.</p>

               <p>To examine belief a little more, there's a serious flaw in the premise of "believe in me, and you will be saved". This necessitates, at some level, the notion that belief is a matter of choice. How can I "choose" to believe in something? I don't believe that belief is something that one can decide. You either believe something, or you don't. Am I really going to be punished in fire and torment, for all eternity, because I didn't de-facto believe something, and used my brain to question the world? Is that really what you think?</p>

               <h5>3. Religious dogma affects everyone</h5>
                <p>People refrain from discussing religion because of the idea that it is a highly personal issue, and isn't for public discussion. I have a strong problem with this sentiment. It's highly idealistic and in practice, religious beliefs strongly inform public policy. Here are some examples of that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states">Gays not being able to get married throughout the U.S.</a></li>
                    <li>Millions of dollars going to fraudulent Christian/Catholic ministers such as Peter Popoff (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYjgeayfYPI">Miracles for Sale</a>)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism">Science education being challenged nationally</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the more extreme end of the spectrum, things get a lot worse:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">The spread of the Islamic State which imposes strict sharia law and summarily executes non-believers</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196165/Britain-85-sharia-courts-The-astonishing-spread-Islamic-justice-closed-doors.html">Sharia courts in Britain to "handle" issues like domestic violence</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/28/taliban-takes-battle-to-schools/?page=all">Schools being destroyed in Afghanistan by the Taliban for not teaching "Islamic Education"</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.endfgm.eu/en/female-genital-mutilation/what-is-fgm/why-is-it-practised/">Female genital mutilation being practiced in Africa in the name of religion</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/muhammad-cartoons-freedom-expression">Free speech being challenged globally by the drawing of the prophet Muhammad</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These issues definitely have more causes than religion alone, but in each case it is one of (if not the) largest contributor. Again, there are many cases where religion positively impacts the world, and you're right, I haven't included them. I haven't included them because as I mentioned previously, I believe that these good things happen anyways without religion. See the <a href="http://www.thinkatheist.com/notes/Secular_charities">list of secular humanitarian organizations</a> that are accomplishing great things.</p> 
                <h5>4. Religious books are ancient, its morality is too</h5>
                <p>Let's assume for a moment that Christianity was the true religion, and that the God depicted in the Holy Bible really exists and that the words in the book were accurate. If I were to take what the bible says, without finding ways to superimpose my own morality over its own projections, I'd be bound by some pretty twisted rules and regulations. Here are a few:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I must fear God (kind of a dick move, but ok)</li>
                   <li>Don't challenge what he says (ok, so far not so bad)</li>
                    <li>Write a copy of the Bible for myself (now that sucks)</li>
                    <li>The death penalty involves decapitation, strangulation, burning with fire, or being stoned to death (woah, things just heated up)</li>
                    <li>If I rape a woman, and then married her legally, I can't divorce her (aw shucks)</li>
                    <li>I can't make any figures for ornament (whatever the fuck that means)</li>
                    <li>I can't consult ghosts (yeah, ok)</li>
                   <li>I can't consult wizards (wut?)</li>
                    <li>I can keep a slave, as long as they're a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaanite</a> (not cool)</li>
                    <li>I can't put olive oil in the meal offering of a woman suspected of adultery (sounds bland)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I could go on, but what's the point. This shit is a waste of time, and it's obviously a waste of time. To find any of the good bits, you have to weed through an insane amount of absolutely irrelevant nonsense. To add insult to injury, when you find a "good" bit, it's bound to be quite obvious like "Don't kill your neighbor", or, "Don't sleep with someone else's wife". These are obviously bad ideas because of the consequences they would incur. You don't need a stupid book to tell you that, you already know it.</p>
                <p>A lot of people I know find themselves picking and choosing which ideas to take away from the Bible. They take bits of the book that they agree with, and discard (or make up an excuse for) the bits that they don't agree with. One interesting question that is raised here is, how do they have the moral authority to make the distinctions between what is good and what is bad when the morals they have are supposed to be derived from the book? This isn't a sound pathway to discovering truth. This is deceit, and the only person you have to blame is yourself. Unless of course you were indoctrinated, then you can probably blame your parents.</p>

                <h4>What Atheism actually is</h4>
                <p>Out of necessity, let's define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheism</a>: "the rejection of belief in the existence of deities."</p>
                <p>That's it. There is no tenet or dogma attached. Atheism is <em>not</em> a belief. It is simply the position that other religions have not met their burden of proof, and thus are not worth believing in. As someone once said, "Atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby." It has nothing to do with evolution, and nothing to do with the big bang theory. Those are entirely separate notions (for one, they are scientific theories), and have literally nothing to do with atheism.</p>
                <p>While we're here, let's also define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">scientific theory</a>: "A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation."</p>
               <p>Note that this is extremely different from the common usage of the word theory, which is more commonly used as "idea". A scientific theory has undergone substantial evaluation, garnered sufficient evidence, has been repeated and confirmed independently, has been documented, etcetera. It is dishonest to use terms like "the <em>theory</em> of evolution", or the "big bang <em>theory</em>" in a belittling manner. It's not like some guy just whipped this stuff up in his basement, and everyone else was like, "Yeah, that makes sense".</p>
                <p>Atheists tend to adopt scientific theories as ways to describe the world we live in, which is probably why the two notions are frequently conflated. The reason these notions are highly correlated (I suspect), is because they both require an exercise in critical thinking. This is a good thing. We need to be critical about the ideas that shape our world.</p>

                <h4>Speaking personally</h4>
                <p>I don't know how the universe began. I don't know if it even had a beginning (before you ask, consider why you feel that <em>everything</em> has to have a beginning). I don't pretend to know. I know that humanity's smartest people tend to agree that there was an expansion event that they dub the "Big Bang", whereby the universe expanded from something incredibly dense to something less-dense. I know that the best evidence available shows us that we are an evolved creature. I know that by considering my actions, and the consequences of those actions, I can come to a conclusion about what is "right" and what is "wrong". By choosing which actions I take, I help define the world that I live in. I know that, for what we don't know, I have zero authority to default some kind of answer, and am entirely comfortable with saying "I don't know". That wasn't always the case, but I hope with some uncomfortable (although enlightening) inquiry of your own, you will be too.</p>

                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions">They can't all be right, but they can all be wrong.</a></p>

Earlier this week, a report surfaced from the Economist on how Vancouver is the second most expensive city in the world to live in (after Hong Kong) as measured by median house prices to household income. The main purpose of the article is to actually question how this can be possible — after all, we only hear of London, New York & Hong Kong being overly expensive to live in. What’s going on over there in little Canada?

People in Vancouver love to talk about housing costs as they would talk about sports. The real estate agents are the ones who are playing the game, and the rest of us sit and speculate on “when this will all crash?”. Usually each conversation ends with an apathetic “aww shucks” attitude. After all — what can you do? This is a dangerous attitude and completely misses a systemic problem that Vancouver faces, that we need to fix soon. This article is about the real issue — the people who move here, and how it affects the long term prospects of this great city.

I’d like to structure this article into three separate sections:

Why house prices won’t go down
Why the price of a house is actually a secondary issue
What to do about it
1 — Why Prices Won’t Go Down

Speculation is an irrelevant activity, no-one can predict the future. (although many claim to) I’m not smart enough to predict the supply and demand of housing in Vancouver — so I’m not going to try. Instead, I’m going to reference an excellent piece on optionality that I found that I believe explains perfectly why house prices will most likely never go down here.

If there are enough rich people in China who want property in Vancouver, prices can float out of reach of the people who actually live and work there. So just because prices look out of whack doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a bubble. Instead, wealthy foreigners are rationally overpaying, in order to protect themselves against risk at home. And the possibility of losing a little money if prices subside won’t deter them. Yan says, “If the choice is between losing ten to twenty per cent in Vancouver versus potentially losing a hundred per cent in Beijing or Tehran, then people are still going to be buying in Vancouver. — http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2014/05/26/140526ta_talk_surowiecki
Did you notice what the number one most expensive city is to live in? Is it any wonder that Vancouver seems “cheap” to those people moving over from Hong Kong?

2 — The Real Problem Isn’t the Cost Of A House

If you believe in the above sentiment, you therefore believe high housing costs are here to stay. People generally accept this. That being said, I think there is a much larger issue that we need to speak about — and that’s the type of person who is buying these homes.

Two types of people own homes in Vancouver — wealthy foreigners who are looking for a place to park their money, and long-time Vancouver residents who have benefited from skyrocketing equity, through no actual effort of their own. There is a simple problem with these people being the primary homeowners in any city — they don’t actually create much value for the place they live in.

A very large percentage of wealthy foreigners who “park” their money here don’t actually live in Vancouver. Take a drive around most expensive areas and you’ll realize the homes are empty. At most, they send their kids to live in Vancouver, learn english/go to school, and then return to their country (usually to Hong Kong). For some reason this is okay with people who live here. The amount of value added to a city from this sort of activity approaches zero. In fact, I’d argue that these people actually leech off of the system more than anything else.

Cities are nothing more than a collection of individuals who occupy an area based on a number of social factors: family, employment, access to lifestyle, climate, etc… And as a collection of people, the value of a city lives and dies with the quality of those people.

The secret that no-one actually wants to talk about is that the quality of a city is mostly determined by a simple factor — the number of smart, ambitious people who live there. These people are the ones who want to drive that city forward by investing in opening businesses, donating their time to the arts & community, participating in city planning, etc… Without them, growth wouldn’t happen and you wouldn’t get all of the benefits that great cities enjoy.

The biggest contributor to the decline of a great city is simple — it’s the decline of those smart people. When they decide that the cost of living in a place outweighs the benefit, they move. They don’t just take their money with them, they take their intellectual and future capital with them. This is dangerous. When people aren’t willing to make an investment in a place to live any more, the city doesn’t just lose their taxes for the year, they lose a massive function of potential jobs created, culture added and future capital they can put to work.

There are a couple of ways to drive people out of a city: high crime rates (Detroit), awful climate (east coast North America) and high housing costs. The caveat with high housing costs is that they are actually fine if the median income of an area matches or grows with housing costs. That’s why places like London, San Francisco & New York actually are actually still doing fine — people are moving to these cities and making lots of money.

The mind boggling thing about Vancouver is that the benefits are massive — insanely good city planning, great safety, a great climate, one of the most beautiful nature-driven places on earth, etc… And yet a single cost — housing, threatens to get rid of all of these good things.

When you drive smart people out of a city by letting zero-value people in, you create a deep asymmetry that is difficult to fix. The right thing to do is so obvious — lower housing costs by any measure & keep smart people in, that it’s fascinating that we struggle so mightily with this issue. How do we fix it?

3 — How to fix this

The biggest factor we need to address is our priorities as a city. Building a new bike lane isn’t a problem — who cares. The number one concern for our city should be to invest in the right kind of people for the future.

Immigration is the number one contributor in most countries to new jobs. In America, around 50% of all founders/CEO’s of the Fortune 500 are immigrants. 40-50% of all new jobs created are by small businesses run by immigrants. It’s a beautiful thing. When people move to a new country or city, and want to contribute to that place, amazing things happen. They sacrifice their immediate term pleasures for the long-term betterment of their lives and the community around them. When they are successful, they then turn around and help those who are just starting out.

We need to foster an immigration system that rewards people who want to be here to build a better life. They should want to contribute to the overall ecosystem — mostly through job creation. More high-skilled (read: non-retail/services) jobs mean more income for citizens, which mean median income goes up, which means people can afford to buy homes, which means people will have families & stay here for longer. The nice thing about attracting smart people to a city is that it actually has an exponential effect — smart people want to be where other smart people are.

So #1 — create a much stricter immigration policy. This is easier said than done and most likely won’t happen, so let’s go to option #2.

IF you want to buy a home in Vancouver to “park” your money here (aka you won’t live here and you won’t create any value) then we are going to force value out of you. I propose that we create a “tax” equal to 1x the value of a home that goes straight into a fund that will encourage small businesses to start up. The average cost of a home in Vancouver is now $1,000,000. So for every million dollar home sold — $1M will go into the fund. Don’t like it? Go park your money somewhere else — the nice effect is that this should also decrease the demand for houses and naturally decrease prices. BUT, if people feel that the cost is still worth it — we will add millions of dollars to a fund that will go straight to the people adding value in the city. The key here must be the people actually managing the money. They need to be entrepreneurs themselves, not risk-averse accountants or consultants who don’t know anything about business.

#3 — reward those people who actually add value. Want to start a business? Are you already employing people? How about no taxes for 10 years? (NY state does this). How about free initial office space? How about subsidized education? Become pro-small business, the economic factor that will actually add jobs to your economy.

#4 — beg, borrow and do anything legal to encourage real companies to open Canadian HQ’s here. Amazon is adding 1000+ jobs to Vancouver as soon as Telus Garden opens, Microsoft already has plans to employ about ~1000 people here. Those workers will make ~100k each — which means they can spend a large amount of that money as discretionary income. Wake up and realize that this is incredibly positive for a region — besides making 100k a year these are smart people who will move to this city. Remember what I said about smart people.

#5 — give massive incentive to real estate developers to build an oversupply of condos/houses. Force prices to drop by simply moving the supply/demand curve. We are already starting to do this — but it’s not moving fast enough.

Vancouver is an amazing place to live, but we need to be careful we don’t destroy what we have wonderful attributes we currently have. The solutions I propose above certainly aren’t the only ones, or even the correct ones, but it’s a start. By recognizing the real issues at hand, I believe we can start to work towards building a Vancouver that is accessible to everyone.
