                <h1>Why Religion is bad and Faith is stupid</h1>
                
                <a class="back-link" href="index.html">&larr; Back to that list of things that isn't this</a>
                
                <p>There, I said it. I'm probably going to receive a lot of shit for posting this, and that's unfortunate. Before you religious lot get all antsy-in-your-pantsies, let me say that I don't necessarily have a problem with your God (I might, but for the sake of argument let's just pretend I don't). I have a problem with your train of thought, and with what effect that same pattern has on the world.</p>
                <p>A lot of people ask me why I even bother talking about religion - why I spend time discussing something that they feel is solely a personal choice, or why it matters at all. I talk about religion because it's important. It's something that, although highly personal, affects people every day in every corner of the globe. Its zealots kill or oppress people daily. Its moderates inform public policy. Its masses perpetuate myth.</p>
                <p>Before I continue on with my negativity, there are a number of positive elements that religion contributes to society (I think that many proponents would argue more than the negative), such as feeding the malnourished or sheltering the homeless. These indeed are honourable efforts driven by I believe places of good will. I do not believe, however, that religion is a requirement for these types of humanitarian efforts to take place. I refuse to accept that without the presence of religion, these efforts would cease to exist.</p>
    
                <h4>Speaking specifically, here's my beef</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Religion is by declaration a divisive force</li>
                    <li>Religion teaches faith is the most admirable virtue</li>
                    <li>Religious dogma affects everyone</li>
                    <li>Religious books are ancient; its morality is too</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h5>1. Religion is a divisive force</h5>
                <p>Religion fosters a very in-group mentality. Many of the worlds religions are mutually exclusive; that is, they don't work together. To each religion, all of the others are deemed incorrect. The way in which these differences in opinion are expressed varies from religion to religion, from culture to culture, and from geography to geography. At best, they ignore each other and somewhat co-exist, agreeing to disagree whenever an incompatibility arises. At worst, they exercise barbarism at its finest.</p>
                <p>To be fair, there are plenty of lines that divide modern society: class, race, gender, location, etcetera. The list goes on. Humanity clearly has enough ways in which it is divided in opinion. We need fewer of these divisions, not more.</p>

                <h5>2. Religion teaches Faith is the most admirable virtue</h5>
                <p>One of the most frustrating points in a discussion with a creationist is the concept of faith. In my opinion, faith is a terrible virtue, and I have serious questions about a deity that would favor faith.</p>
                <p>First, let's refresh ourselves on what the word really means. As defined by reference.com, Faith is described as "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith">belief that is not based on proof.</a>" If you're thinking right now, "Well, that's not what <em>I</em> believe. I believe that Faith is something that I just <em>feel</em> is true.", well, I hate to break it to you but your definition falls into that category.</p>
                <p>One thing that I often hear about how, as an "Atheist" I too have faith. Faith in scientists, and in science itself, or something like that. No. No no no no no. I <em>trust</em> findings of modern scientists because of the rigidity and the dependability of the scientific method which they employ. I can <em>observe</em> their conclusions that I am able to understand by seeing the fruits of their labour, by reading consensus in the scientific community at large, or by testing ideas myself. For topics beyond my comprehension, of which there are many, I can take comfort that the same scientific rigourousness was applied in their discovery. I take nothing at face value, and will readily abandon my notions about the world should they turn out to be false. That is one of the most liberating benefits of a life without dogma.</p>
                
                <p>Second, look at faith as a virtue. In our daily lives, we rely on reason, logic, and knowledge to survive. In this society, in this modern time, it's hard for us (myself included) to even comprehend what "survival" really is because we rarely (if ever) are forced to think about it. We know (as a collective) what foods are safe to eat, we know that lead is toxic to life, and we (most of us anyways) have a reasonable understanding of how to behave in society. We've learned this through a long chain of trial and error. When decisions in life are commonplace or simple, the answer is often dismissed as being common-sense. In reality, we're leveraging a vast source of knowledge to reach a conclusion. For example, the question <em>"Why shouldn't I put my finger into this electrical socket?"</em> is simple because experience, education, and understanding have taught you the answer. When we're faced with a more difficult question such as, "What happens when we die?", and don't have (or are reluctant to accept) the answer, many of us feel incredibly unsettled. This is where we turn to God. Neil deGrasse Tyson describes this pattern as the "perimeter of ignorance".
                <p>Lastly, would God really regard faith as such an important virtue? Why not love, compassion, honesty, or integrity? Why hold faith above these virtues? What kind of omnipotence would utter something like "My faithful disciple, you have believed in me when I have left you no reason to do so. You shall be eternally rewarded." You rely on your faculties to reach conclusions about every other aspect in your life, from finances to food, from health to technology. Hold your religious beliefs to the same level of scrutiny.</p>

                <h5>3. Religious dogma affects everyone</h5>
                <p>People refrain from discussing religion because of the idea that it is a highly personal issue, and isn't for public discussion. I have a strong problem with this sentiment. It's highly idealistic and in practice, religious beliefs strongly inform public policy. Here are some examples of that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states">Gays not being able to get married throughout the U.S.</a></li>
                    <li>Millions of dollars going to fraudulent Christian/Catholic ministers such as Peter Popoff (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYjgeayfYPI">Miracles for Sale</a>)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism">Science education being challenged nationally</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the more extreme end of the spectrum, things get a lot worse:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">The spread of the Islamic State which imposes strict sharia law and summarily executes non-believers</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196165/Britain-85-sharia-courts-The-astonishing-spread-Islamic-justice-closed-doors.html">Sharia courts in Britain to "handle" issues like domestic violence</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/28/taliban-takes-battle-to-schools/?page=all">Schools being destroyed in Afghanistan by the Taliban for not teaching "Islamic Education"</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.endfgm.eu/en/female-genital-mutilation/what-is-fgm/why-is-it-practised/">Female genital mutilation being practiced in Africa in the name of religion</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/muhammad-cartoons-freedom-expression">Free speech being challenged globally by the drawing of the prophet Mohammed</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These issues definitely have more causes than religion alone, but in each case it is one of (if not the) largest contributor. Again, there are many cases where religion positively impacts the world, and you're right, I haven't included them. I haven't included them because as I mentioned previously, I believe that these good things happen anyways without religion. See the <a href="http://www.thinkatheist.com/notes/Secular_charities">list of secular humanitarian organizations</a> that are accomplishing great things.</p> 
                <h5>4. Religious books are ancient, its morality is too</h5>
                <p>Let's assume for a moment that Christianity was the true religion, and that the God depicted in the Holy Bible really exists and that the words in the book were accurate. If I were to take what the bible says, without finding ways to superimpose my own morality over its own projections, I'd be bound by some pretty twisted rules and regulations. Here are a few:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I must fear God (kind of a dick move, but ok)</li>
                    <li>Don't challenge what he says (ok, so far not so bad)</li>
                    <li>Write a copy of the Bible for myself (now that sucks)</li>
                    <li>The death penalty involves decapitation, strangulation, burning with fire, or being stoned to death (woah, things just heated up)</li>
                    <li>If I rape a woman, and then married her legally, I can't divorce her (aw shucks)</li>
                    <li>I can't make any figures for ornament (whatever the fuck that means)</li>
                    <li>I can't consult ghosts (yeah, ok)</li>
                    <li>I can't consult wizards (wut?)</li>
                    <li>I can keep a slave, as long as they're a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaanite</a> (not cool)</li>
                    <li>I can't put olive oil in the meal offering of a woman suspected of adultery (sounds bland)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I could go on, but what's the point. This shit is a waste of time, and it's obviously a waste of time. To find any of the good bits, you have to weed through an insane amount of absolutely irrelevant nonsense. To add insult to injury, when you find a "good" bit, it's bound to be quite obvious like "Don't kill your neighbor", or, "Don't sleep with someone else's wife". These are obviously bad ideas because of the consequences they would incur. You don't need a stupid book to tell you that, you already know it.</p>
                <p>A lot of people I know find themselves picking and choosing which ideas to take away from the Bible. They take bits of the book that they agree with, and discard (or make up an excuse for) the bits that they don't agree with. One interesting question that is raised here is, how do they have the moral authority to make the distinctions between what is good and what is bad when the morals they have are supposed to be derived from the book? This isn't a sound pathway to discovering truth people. This is deceit, and the only person you have to blame is yourself.</p>

                <h4>What Atheism actually is</h4>
                <p>Out of necessity, let's define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheism</a>: "the rejection of belief in the existence of deities."</p>
                <p>That's it. There is no tenet or dogma attached. Atheism is <em>not</em> a belief. It is simply the position that other religions have not met their burden of proof, and thus are not worth believing in. As someone once said, "Atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby." It has nothing to do with evolution, and nothing to do with the big bang theory. Those are entirely separate notions (for starts they are scientific theories), and have literally nothing to do with theology.</p>
                <p>While we're here, let's also define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">scientific theory</a>: "A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation."</p>
                <p>Note that this is extremely different from the common usage of the word theory, which is more commonly used as "idea". A scientific theory has undergone substantial evaluation, garnered sufficient evidence, has been repeated and confirmed independently, has been documented, etcetera.</p>

                <h4>Speaking personally</h4>
                <p>I don't know how the universe began. I don't know if it even had a beginning (before you ask, consider why you feel that <em>everything</em> has to have a beginning). I don't pretend to know. I know that humanity's smartest people tend to agree that there was an expansion event that they dub the "Big Bang", whereby the universe expanded from something incredibly dense to something less-dense. I know that the best evidence available shows us that we are an evolved creature. I know that by considering my actions, and the consequences of those actions, I can come to a conclusion about what is "right" and what is "wrong". By choosing which actions I take, I help define the world that I live in. I know that, for what we don't know, I have zero authority to default some kind of answer, and am entirely comfortable with saying "I don't know". That wasn't always the case, but I hope with some uncomfortable (although enlightening) inquiry of your own, you will be too.</p>
